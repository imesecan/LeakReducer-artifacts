Top 10 configurations from the parameter tuning
tests. Table below shows 3 parameters: 
1) Population Size, 
2) Mutation Rate, 
3) Crossover Rate,

and the p-value and Mean Fitness for 
the configurations. 
The table is ordered according to the mean 
fitness of configurations. Student's t-test 
was used to measure statistical evidence of 
difference in means. There are 6 configurations 
with ```p-value < 0.05```, only the 3 are shown
are listed below.

Pop. Size | Mut. Rate | Cross. Rate |  p-value | Mean Fitness
----------|-----------|-------------|----------|-------------
